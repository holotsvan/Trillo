This GitHub project contains my code and notes from a training course on Sass and Flexbox. I learned how to use Sass to create reusable CSS variables, mixins, and functions. I also learned how to use Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts.

**Sass** is a preprocessor that extends CSS with additional features, such as variables, mixins, and functions. This makes it easier to write and maintain CSS code.

**Flexbox** is a CSS layout module that allows you to easily create flexible and responsive layouts. Flexbox containers can be divided into rows or columns, and the items inside the container can be flexibly sized and positioned.

In this project, I have created a site to train my Sass and Flexbox skills. I have created a navigation bar, and a product card layout using Sass and Flexbox.

Here are some of the things I learned from this training project:

* How to use Sass variables to create reusable CSS values.
* How to use Sass mixins to encapsulate CSS code and make it reusable.
* How to use Sass functions to perform complex CSS calculations.
* How to use Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts.
* How to use Flexbox to align and distribute items inside a container.
* How to use Flexbox to create responsive breakpoints.

I am glad I had the opportunity to take this training course on Sass and Flexbox. I learned a lot of new skills that I will be able to use in my future web development projects.
